# üèÅ Formula 1 Clutch Impact Adjustments (Non-Winning Machinery Emphasis)

## Philosophy: Motorsport ‚â† Just Driver Skill
In Formula 1, car performance often masks true driver ability. Our clutch impact ratings prioritize:
- **Extracting maximum from inferior cars**
- **Wet weather mastery** (the great equalizer)
- **Strategic brilliance** over raw speed in dominant machinery
- **Consistency across different teams/eras**
