| 4 | **Wayne Gretzky** | Hockey | 95.9 | **95.4** | ‚¨áÔ∏è -0.5 (offense-first player) |
| 5 | **Cristiano Ronaldo** | Football | 94.8 | **92.9** | ‚¨áÔ∏è -1.9 (realistic defense) |

**Players DROPPED out of Top 15:**
- **Giba** (#8 ‚Üí #28): 93.9 ‚Üí 79.8 (volleyball multiplier)
- **Lewis Hamilton** (#5 ‚Üí #16): 95.1 ‚Üí 88.6 (equipment dependency)
- **Karabatic** (#20 ‚Üí #35): 90.0 ‚Üí 76.5 (handball multiplier)

## ‚úÖ **What This System Fixes:**

1. **Position Reality**: Forwards can't have 8+ defensive ratings
2. **Era Appropriate**: 1960s Pel√© didn't press like modern players
3. **Sport Weighting**: Global sports get proper recognition
4. **Two-Way Balance**: Actual defenders get credit they deserve
5. **Equipment Sports**: F1 rated for skill vs. car advantage

This creates a much more factual and defensible ranking system!
